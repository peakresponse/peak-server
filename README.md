# Peak Response Server

This is the server repository for Peak Response. For the iOS
mobile app repository, visit:

https://github.com/peakresponse/peak-ios

Peak Response (formerly NaTriage) was initially developed as part of the
NIST PSCR Tech to Protect Challenge in 2019 to create new technologies for
emergency responders.

## Getting Started (Local Evaluation and Development)

1. Install Docker Desktop for Windows or Mac: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/  
   Install Docker Engine for Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/

2. Clone this git repo to a "local" directory (on your computer), then change
   into the directory.

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/peakresponse/peak-server.git
   $ cd peak-server
   ```

   Windows: BEFORE executing the clone command, make sure that git is configured
   to preserve text line endings. To check, execute this git command and check
   the following setting:

   ```
   $ git config -l
   ...
   core.autocrlf=false
   ...
   ```

   Make sure that the `core.autocrlf` setting is `false` or `input`. To change this
   setting, you can set it like this:

   ```
   $ git config --global core.autcrlf false
   ```

3. Open a command-line shell, change into your repo directory, and execute this command:

   ```
   $ docker compose pull
   ```

   Please wait while Docker downloads the container images needed to run the server.

4. Start the containers:

   ```
   $ docker compose up
   ```

   Please wait while a one-time database initialization is performed. This may take some
   minutes depending upon the performance of your host computer. When you see messages that
   look like this, the server is running:

   ```
   server_1       | 2:14:26 AM web.1     |  > app@0.0.0 start /opt/node/app
   server_1       | 2:14:26 AM web.1     |  > nodemon -V ./bin/www
   server_1       | 2:14:26 AM web.1     |  [nodemon] 1.19.0
   server_1       | 2:14:26 AM web.1     |  [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
   server_1       | 2:14:26 AM web.1     |  [nodemon] or send SIGHUP to 57 to restart
   ```

5. Log in to the running server container and create an initial bootstrap admin user account:

   ```
   $ docker compose exec server bash -l
   ```

   The above command will log you in to the running server container. Then, execute
   the following script on the server, replacing the parameters on the command line with your own
   account information:

   ```
   # bin/create-admin Firstname Lastname email@address.com password
   ```

6. Now, use that bootstrap admin user account to log in to the Admin dashboard at: http://peakresponse.localhost:3000/admin

7. Once logged in, click on States in the left sidebar, find the state you wish to set up and click on it,
   then click on the Configure button. Please wait while state-specific agency and facility data is downloaded
   and loaded into the database. This may again take some minutes depending upon the size of the data
   and the performance of your host computer. Once completed, you can browse the imported data in the Agencies
   and Facilities sections linked from the left sidebar.

8. Once configured, log out of the Admin dashboard from the top navbar, then create your first Agency account
   at: http://peakresponse.localhost:3000/sign-up

   Select the State you configured, go next, then search for the Agency you wish to set up, then continue
   through the rest of the flow.

   Note that, during this set-up, email will be sent to a catch-all test mail server which also provides a web-based
   interface for inspecting sent email at:

   http://peakresponse.localhost:1080/

9. Once the first Agency account is set up and configured, you can then log in at the agency specific
   url subdomain you set up: http://your-agency-subdomain.peakresponse.localhost:3000/

   Certain features of the web interface require a secure HTTPS connection to function. To test
   locally, use Google Chrome or Chromium, and add the agency url in Chrome flags (go to chrome://flags
   in a new tab or window) under the setting _Insecure origins treated as secure_ and make sure the
   setting is enabled.

10. This default development docker-compose.yml configuration mounts the repository directory
    inside the running container. Any edits saved to the server source files will be detected
    by nodemon and the server restarted. Any edits saved to the web app client source files
    will be detected by the webpack-development-server, triggering a browser refresh after
    a rebuild. For a production deployment, refer to additional notes below.

    Other useful commands you can run while logged in to the server container include:

    ```
    # psql $DATABASE_URL
    ```

    The above command will open the postgres command line utility for inspecting the database.

    ```
    # sequelize db:create --env=test
    # sequelize db:migration --env=test
    # npm test
    ```

    The above commands will set up a test database and run the continuous integration test suite.

11. To stop the server, press CONTROL-C in the shell with the running server.
    If it is successful, you will see something like this:

    ```
    Killing peak-server_db_1           ... done
    Killing peak-server_server_1       ... done
    ```

    If it is not successful, you may see something like this:

    ```
    ERROR: Aborting.
    ```

    If you get an error, the server may still be running on your computer. To force it to stop,
    run the following command and wait for the output to report DONE:

    ```
    $ docker compose stop
    Stopping peak-server_db_1          ... done
    Stopping peak-server_server_1      ... done
    ```

## Production Deployment

1. The initialization of the development environment above creates a file called `.env` in your
   root repository initialized from the contents of `example.env`. These are environment
   variables that configure aspects of the server deployment, and can be modified accordingly.
   The `.env` file is ignored by git, and secrets should not be checked in to any publicly
   available repository.

2. For a more production-focused deployment, use the following command to start the server:

   ```
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.deploy.yml up
   ```

   The deploy configuration does not include the test email server from the development
   configuration (please set the SMTP\_\* variables in `.env` for your mail server). It also
   does not mount or watch the server source files on your host computer- it runs only
   the code as it was originally built and compiled during the creation of the container image.

3. If you have made modifications to the server source code, you can re-build your own image
   with the following command:

   ```
   $ docker compose build server
   ```

4. Production deployments must be served over secure HTTPS connections. Setup of a secure
   front-end (i.e. nginx, apache) with SSL certificates is out of the scope of this
   README file, but there are many web resources and options for this depending
   upon your hosting environment.

## Docker Command Quick Reference

- To start all the containers:

  ```
  $ docker compose up
  ```

- To log in to the running server container:

  ```
  $ docker compose exec server bash -l
  ```

- To stop all the containers, in case things didn't shutdown properly with CTRL-C:

  ```
  $ docker compose stop
  ```

- To run the server container without starting everything using the up command:

  ```
  $ docker compose run --rm server bash -l
  ```

- To re-build the server container:

  ```
  $ docker compose build server
  ```

## Docker Troubleshooting

- On some PC laptops, a hardware CPU feature called virtualization is disabled by default, which is required by Docker. To enable it, reboot your computer into its BIOS interface (typically by pressing a key like DELETE or F1 during the boot process), and look for an option to enable it. It may be called something like _Intel Virtualization Technology_, _Intel VT_, _AMD-V_, _AMD SMV Mode_, or some similar variation.

## Shell Command Quick Reference

- Every directory and file on your computer has a _path_ that describes its location in storage. Special path symbols include:

  - The current _working directory_ you are in: `.`
  - The _parent_ of the current working directory: `..`
  - Your _home_ directory: `~`
  - The _root_ directory: `/` (Mac, Linux) or `\` (Windows)
    - The same symbol is used as a _separator_ when specifying multiple directories in a path
    - If the path _starts_ with the separator, it means the path starts at the _root_
      - For example: `/Users/myusername/Documents`
      - This is called an _absolute_ path
    - If the path _does not start_ with the separator, it means the path starts at the current _working directory_
      - For example, if the current _working directory_ is: `/Users`  
        then the same path as the previous example is: `myusername/Documents`
      - This is called a _relative_ path
    - A path can also start with any of the above special path symbols
      - For example, on Mac the same path as the previous example is: `~/Documents`

- To _print the working directory_ (i.e. to see the full path of the directory you are currently in):

  ```
  $ pwd
  ```

- To _list_ the files in the working directory:

  ```
  $ ls -l
  ```

- To _change_ the working directory:

  ```
  $ cd path
  ```

- To _make_ a new directory inside the working directory:

  ```
  $ mkdir newpath
  ```

- To create a new _empty file_ inside the working directory:

  ```
  $ touch filename.ext
  ```

## git Command Quick Reference

- To check the _status_ of the files in your local repo (i.e. what's been added or changed):

  ```
  $ git status
  ```

- To _add all_ the changed files to the next commit:

  ```
  $ git add .
  ```

  To _add specific file(s)_ to the next commit:

  ```
  $ git add path/to/file1.ext path/to/file2.ext path/with/wildcard/*
  ```

- To _commit_ the added files with a message:

  ```
  $ git commit -m "My description of what's changed"
  ```

- To _push_ the commit to the remote repo:

  ```
  $ git push
  ```

- To _pull_ any new commits from the remote repo:

  ```
  $ git pull
  ```
