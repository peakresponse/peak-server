      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <h3>Dedicated to providing life saving efficiency.</h3>
      <p class="mb-5">Peak Response (formerly NaTriage) was initially conceptualized in 2019 as part of the Tech to Protect Challenge, sponsored by NIST PSCR, aimed at fostering technological innovation for emergency responders. The solution came out of a focus on a common pain point: time spent documenting injuries and incidents at the scene of mass casualty incidents. These incidents are chaotic, high-pressure environments where time spent documenting can mean the difference between life and death. The quick tag scan and speech-to-text form filling were the first features, but the solution quickly expanded to include a variety of powerful sorting and data export options to improve efficiency, both at the point of contact with the patient and also for the incident commander monitoring the entire scene.</p>
